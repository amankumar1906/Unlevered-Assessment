# Unlevered Frontend Interview Task

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this task. Below is the detailed description of the project I developed for the first stage of the interview.

## Project Description

This project is a dummy front-end user interface that displays various financial data regarding Apple Inc. The user interface was created using React with TypeScript. The project includes a candlestick chart and various key financial ratios.

## Steps Taken

1. **React and TypeScript**: Used React with TypeScript to create a robust and type-safe user interface.
2. **Docker**: Successfully ran a Docker container to host a Flask server that returned JSON data for the task.
3. **CORS Error Handling**: Faced CORS issues while fetching data from the Flask server. To avoid this:
   - Downloaded the data remotely.
   - Wrote an Express server to fetch the data locally, which avoided CORS issues.
4. **Analyst Estimates**: Some analyst estimates were not available, so dummy data was added for those companies.
5. **Stock Data**: Downloaded stock data for Apple remotely due to restrictions in fetching online APIs.
6. **API Usage**: Avoided using online APIs directly due to fetching restrictions and used the downloaded data instead.

Thank you again for the opportunity. If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to contact me.
